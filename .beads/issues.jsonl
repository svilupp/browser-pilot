The refMap is scoped to a Page instance and is created fresh for each bp exec invocation. Need to update SKILL.md to clarify: 1) Refs require snapshot action in SAME exec call, 2) bp snapshot + separate bp exec won't work, 3) Add working example pattern.","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2026-01-02T09:46:23.094639Z","created_by":"jsiml","updated_at":"2026-01-02T09:46:23.094639Z"}

However, there's no test verifying that the INCORRECT workflow fails as expected: 1) bp snapshot (standalone) shows refs, 2) bp exec with ref:eX in separate call should fail gracefully. Add negative test to document/verify this limitation, helping users understand why their workflow doesn't work.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-02T09:46:38.557852Z","created_by":"jsiml","updated_at":"2026-01-02T09:46:38.557852Z"}
